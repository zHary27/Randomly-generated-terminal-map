# Randomly generated terminal map with BFS and DFS AI algorithms
I made a randomly generated map with some rocks (hashtags), a start position, a objective and a BFS or DFS (you choose) algorithm AI that tests if the map is possible to beat, so it will ever be possible. After it's created, you are able to play it using "WASD". In the minigame, you are a "O" character and you objective "A".
