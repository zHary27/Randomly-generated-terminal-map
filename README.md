# Randomly generated terminal map
I made a randomly generated map with some rocks (hashtags), a start position and a final position and a BFS or DFS (you choose) algorithm AI that tests if the map is possible to beat, so it will ever be possible. after it gets created, you are able to play it using "WASD". In the minigame, you are a "O" character and you objective "A".
